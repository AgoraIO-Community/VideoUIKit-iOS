    /**
     Occurs when a remote user (Communication)/host (Live Broadcast) leaves a channel. Same as userOfflineBlock.

     There are two reasons for users to be offline:

     - Leave a channel: When the user/host leaves a channel, the user/host sends a goodbye message. When the message is received, the SDK assumes that the user/host leaves a channel.
     - Drop offline: When no data packet of the user or host is received for a certain period of time (20 seconds for the Communication profile, and more for the live interactive streaming profile), the SDK assumes that the user/host drops offline. Unreliable network connections may lead to false detections, so Agora recommends using the [Agora RTM SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/product_rtm?platform=All%20Platforms) for more reliable offline detection.

     - Parameters:
         - engine: AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
         - uid: ID of the user or host who leaves a channel or goes offline.
         - reason: Reason why the user goes offline, see AgoraUserOfflineReason.

     who is detected as the loudest for the most times, is the most active user.

     - If the most active speaker is always the same user, the SDK triggers this callback only once.
     - If the most active speaker changes to another user, the SDK triggers this callback again and reports the `uid` of the new active speaker.

         - speakerUid: The user ID of the most active speaker.
