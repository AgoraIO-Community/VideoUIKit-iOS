The `AgoraVideoViewController`implements the `AgoraRtcEngineDelegate` to handle the Agora RTC Engine events. Within these delegate functions the managed ui handles the UI  updates when a ARBroadcaster joins or leaves the channel.

     The SDK triggers this callback under one of the following circumstances: - A remote user/host joins the channel by calling the joinChannelByToken method. - A remote user switches the user role to the host by calling the setClientRole method after joining the channel. - A remote user/host rejoins the channel after a network interruption. - A host injects an online media stream into the channel by calling the addInjectStreamUrl method.

Unreliable network connections may lead to false detections, so Agora recommends using a signaling system for more reliable offline detection.

         - speakers: AgoraRtcAudioVolumeInfo array. An empty speakers array in the callback indicates that no remote user is speaking at the moment.
             - In the local userâs callback, this array contains the following members: uid = 0, volume = totalVolume, which reports the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of the local user, and vad, which reports the voice activity status of the local user.
             - In the remote speakers' callback, this array contains the following members: uid of each remote speaker, volume, which reports the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of each remote speaker, and vad = 0.
         - totalVolume:Total volume after audio mixing. The value range is [0,255].
             - In the local userâs callback, totalVolume is the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of the local user.
             - In the remote speakers' callback, totalVolume is the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of all the remote speakers.
      - NOTE:To enable the voice activity detection of the local user, ensure that you set `report_vad(YES)` in the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method.

              - If the local user calls the [muteLocalAudioStream](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/oc/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/muteLocalAudioStream:) method, the SDK stops triggering the local userâs callback immediately.
              - 20 seconds after a remote speaker calls the `muteLocalAudioStream` method, the remote speakers' callback excludes information of this user; 20 seconds after all remote users call the `muteLocalAudioStream` method, the SDK stops triggering the remote speakers' callback.
      
      This callback reports the IDs and volumes of the loudest speakers at the moment in the channel, and whether the local user is speaking.  By default, this callback is disabled. You can enable it by calling the enableAudioVolumeIndication method. Once enabled, this callback is triggered at the set interval, regardless of whether a user speaks or not. The SDK triggers two independent [reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/oc/Protocols/AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.html#//api/name/rtcEngine:reportAudioVolumeIndicationOfSpeakers:totalVolume:) callbacks at one time, which separately report the volume information of the local user and all the remote speakers.
